# CI safety

Ground rules for touching CI. Each rule exists because breaking it cost hours; the
incidents are in `references/incidents.md` (read that file, do not execute it). The
scripts in `scripts/` enforce most rules mechanically. Where a rule is enforced by a
script, your job is to run the script and read its JSON, not to re-derive the check.

Violating the letter of these rules is violating the spirit of these rules.

**Where the scripts are.** `S` is this skill's `scripts/` directory, next to this
SKILL.md. Set it once per session, for example `S=.agents/skills/ci-safety/scripts`
(or `.claude/skills/ci-safety/scripts` where that is the installed copy), then run every
script as `$S/<script>`.

## §1 Truth is the run for the PR's current head SHA

Only a run whose `head_sha` equals the PR's current head says anything about the PR.
`$S/ci-runs <pr>` selects those runs for you and ignores everything else. Never
use `gh run list --commit` (returns empty) or `gh pr checks` (403s on some tokens and
renders cancelled as fail). An empty result means "not ready", never "green".

## §2 Cancelled is not failure

| conclusion | meaning | action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `failure` | ran and failed | classify (§3) |
| `cancelled` | superseded, or a dependent job died | not evidence; find the run for the current head |
| `skipped` | path filter | neutral |
| `success` on an old head | green for old code | not green for this PR |

A wall of red that appeared at once is a cancellation cascade. `ci-runs` puts each
job's `conclusion` in `failed_jobs` and sets `all_cancelled: true` when every failed
job was cancelled; read both before reacting.

## §3 Classify before acting: three buckets

`$S/ci-watch` attaches a `bucket_hint` to every failed job:

| bucket_hint | how it was set | your action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `infra` | log matched a runner or network failure pattern | verified retry (§4) within budget |
| `known_flake` | log matched a line in the consumer's flake signatures file | first time on this PR: verified retry. Second time, same signature, same PR: stop and root-cause |
| `unknown` | neither matched | read `log_tail`; decide `real` or `flake`; say which evidence decided it |

The hint is a hint. You must state the bucket you settled on and the evidence line.
A second occurrence of the same signature on the same PR is never a flake: patterns
have causes.

## §4 Retries are verified or they did not happen

`gh run rerun` exits 0 and does nothing when the run is still in progress. Only
`$S/verified-rerun <run_id> --pr <pr>` may be used to retry. Exit 0 means the
attempt counter incremented; report "retried (attempt N)". Exit 1 means it did not
happen; report exactly that and do not count it against the budget. Exit 4 means a
precondition failed (run in progress, or stale head) and the JSON `reason` says which.

## §5 Check base freshness before any retry

If `main` already contains a fix for the failing lane, no retry can pass:

    git fetch origin "$($S/repo-config VIVI_DEFAULT_BRANCH)"
    git log --oneline "HEAD..origin/$($S/repo-config VIVI_DEFAULT_BRANCH)" -- <paths of the failing lane>

`$S/repo-config VIVI_DEFAULT_BRANCH` prints the consumer's default branch as a bare
string, so it drops straight into a command; a skill never names the branch itself.

If that log is non-empty, rebase first and let the fresh run speak.

## §6 A watcher never exits "unknown"

`$S/ci-watch` retries transient API errors internally, follows the PR if the
head moves mid-watch (`head_changed: true`), and ends only in `green`, `failed` or
`timed_out`. If it exits 4 with `timed_out`, report the last known state and the
elapsed time. "Unknown" is not a state you may report.

## Output contract

Any skill acting on CI ends with the `CI_RESULT` JSON from `$S/ci-watch`,
validated by `$S/validate ci_result <file>`. Numbers you did not see in a
script's output do not go in the block.
