# Watch CI

Wait for a PR's CI, retry only what may be retried, and hand back a verified result.
Rules: the ci-safety skill (read it once per session). Every mechanical step below is a
script in this skill's `scripts/` directory; run it and read its JSON. Do not replace a
script with your own `gh` command.

**Where the scripts are.** `S` is this skill's `scripts/` directory, next to this
SKILL.md. Set it once per session, for example `S=.agents/skills/watch-ci/scripts`
(or `.claude/skills/watch-ci/scripts` where that is the installed copy), then run every
script as `$S/<script>`.

## Inputs

- PR number. If not given, detect it: `$S/vgh pr view --json number --jq .number`.
- Issue number for state, if known; otherwise use the PR number.

## Budget

| resource | budget |
| --- | --- |
| verified retries per PR | 2 |
| same flake signature on this PR | 1 retry, then root-cause |
| wall clock per watch | 60 minutes |

Read the budget already spent before acting: `$S/state get <issue>`.

## Procedure

1. Record the phase: `$S/state set <issue> phase watching`.

2. Watch: `$S/ci-watch <pr> > .agents/state/<issue>-ci.json`. This blocks until a
   terminal state. Read the exit code and the JSON in that file.
   - exit 0, `state: green`: go to step 6.
   - exit 4, `state: timed_out`: report the last state and elapsed time (ci-safety §6),
     go to step 6.
   - exit 1, `state: failed`: continue.
   - any other exit: the JSON has an `error`; report it and stop.

3. Save what you saw, mechanically; do not retype values from the JSON:

   ```sh
   $S/state set <issue> head_sha "$(jq -r .head_sha .agents/state/<issue>-ci.json)"
   $S/state set <issue> failures "$(jq -c .failures .agents/state/<issue>-ci.json)"
   ```

4. Classify every entry in `failures` (ci-safety §3). For each job write one line:
   `<job>: <bucket> because <evidence line from log_tail or signature_match>`.
   - `infra` hint: bucket is `infra`.
   - `known_flake` hint: check whether the signature was already seen on this PR:
     `$S/state get <issue> seen_signatures | jq -e --arg s "<signature_match>"
     'index($s) != null'`. Exit 0 means already seen; bucket is `real` (second
     occurrence). A missing key prints nothing, and `jq -e` on empty input exits
     nonzero, which correctly reads as "not seen": bucket is `known_flake` and you run
     `$S/state append <issue> seen_signatures "<signature_match>"`.
   - `unknown` hint: if `log_error` is true, do not classify; report
     `<job>: log unavailable` and treat it as `unknown` for the retry decision.
     Otherwise read `log_tail`: assertion mismatches, compile, vet or lint errors, and
     failures in code the PR touches are `real`. Anything else stays `unknown`, and
     `unknown` is treated as `real` for the retry decision.

5. Act:
   - Any job is `real` or `unknown`: do not retry. Go to step 7.
   - All jobs are `infra` or first-occurrence `known_flake`, and retries spent < 2:
     first check base freshness (ci-safety §5). If `main` touches the failing lane,
     report "rebase needed" and go to step 6. Otherwise run
     `$S/verified-rerun <run_id> --pr <pr>` for each distinct `run_id` in
     `failures`.
       - exit 0: `$S/state incr <issue> retries`, then return to step 2.
       - exit 1: report "retry did not happen" with the JSON `reason`; do not count it;
         return to step 2 once (the run may have been mid-transition). If it happens a
         second time, go to step 6 and report `retries_unverified` as 0 and the reason
         in your classification lines.
       - exit 4: report the `reason`; return to step 2.
   - Retries spent = 2: stop retrying. Go to step 7.

6. Finish: take the CI_RESULT JSON from the last `$S/ci-watch` run (the file saved
   in step 2), set its `retries_verified` field to the integer from state, and validate
   the result:

   ```sh
   n=$($S/state get <issue> retries); n=${n:-0}
   jq --argjson n "$n" \
     '.retries_verified=$n' .agents/state/<issue>-ci.json > .agents/state/<issue>-final.json
   $S/validate ci_result .agents/state/<issue>-final.json
   ```

   `state get` prints nothing (not the literal `0`) when the key was never set, so
   check for emptiness in the shell before handing the value to `jq --argjson`; an
   empty string there is invalid JSON and jq will reject it.

   This must print `{"valid":true}`. Then `$S/state set <issue> phase done` and
   print the validated JSON as the final `CI_RESULT` block.

7. Investigate a real failure (a judgment step):
   1. Name the failing test, file and line from `log_tail`.
   2. Read that file and the PR's diff to it.
   3. Reproduce locally using the command for that area from the file named by
      `VIVI_TEST_COMMANDS_FILE` in `repo.env`. If it passes locally and failed in CI
      twice, that is a timing bug in the code, not a flake.
   4. Propose or apply the minimal fix. Never disable or delete a test to get green.
   5. If the fix needs a decision outside the PR's scope, stop and report.
   Then go to step 6 with `state: failed` and your classification lines.

## Report

End with the classification lines from step 4, then the validated `CI_RESULT` block.
Every number in the block came from a script. If you retried, the block's
`retries_verified` equals the number of `verified-rerun` exit-0 results you saw.

## Red flags

- "I'll run `gh run rerun` directly, it is faster": you will report a retry that did
  not happen. Use `verified-rerun`.
- "The flake list matched, retry again": the list buys one retry per signature per PR.
- "It is probably still running, I'll say unknown": the watcher's `timed_out` is the
  state; report it with the elapsed time.
- "CI is red so the PR is broken": read `conclusion` first (ci-safety §2).
