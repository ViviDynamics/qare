# Security Policy

qare is a QA agent harness. It boots applications from pull requests, runs AI
agents against them, and posts results back to GitHub, so it is held to the same
security posture as Coordinare itself. We take reports seriously, and we would
much rather hear from you than read about it later.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report privately, through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for
this repository:

**https://github.com/ViviDynamics/qare/security/advisories/new**

This is the only reporting route. We deliberately publish no email address:
an address that bounces or goes unread is worse than none, and a private
advisory keeps the report where the fix will happen.

Private vulnerability reporting is a feature of public repositories. If the
route above is not available to you, qare is not yet public, and the
channel opens when it is.

If you cannot use private advisories at all, start a
[discussion](https://github.com/ViviDynamics/qare/discussions) asking us to
open a private channel with you, and **do not include any detail about the
vulnerability in it**: not the affected component, not the reproduction, not
the impact. Just ask for the channel.

## What to expect

We read every report. We respond and fix as capacity allows.

We are not going to promise you a schedule. qare is given away free
of charge under a source-available license with no support contract, and a
timeframe we cannot reliably meet would be worth less to you than an honest
statement that we have not committed to one. Nothing here creates an
obligation, and the license disclaims all warranties.

If your own disclosure timeline matters to you, say so in the report and we
will tell you plainly whether we can work to it.

## Releases and fixes

No release carries a support commitment, including the most recent one. Fixes
land on `main` when they land. There is no backport process and no
long-term-support line.

If you are running this in an environment where that is not good enough, run
it from a commit you have reviewed and pin it yourself.

## Contributions

qare does not accept public pull requests, including security
fixes. This is itself a supply-chain security measure. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Report the issue and we will implement the
fix internally, with credit to you in the advisory if you would like it.
