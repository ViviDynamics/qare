# Copilot Review

**A request is not a review.** Copilot can accept a review request and never deliver.
The outcome passes only when a review object arrives with `submitted_at` after the
request. "Requested, nothing arrived" is `review_received: false`, and a caller using
this as a gate treats it as unsatisfied, never as a clean review.

**Where the scripts are.** `S` is this skill's `scripts/` directory, next to this
SKILL.md. Set it once per session, for example `S=.agents/skills/copilot-review/scripts`,
then run every `gh` call as `$S/vgh`. Let `R=$($S/repo-config VIVI_REPO)`.

## Inputs

- PR number. If not given: `$S/vgh pr view --json number --jq .number`.

## Loop (cap: 8 rounds)

1. **Request, reliably.** Adding Copilot silently no-ops when it is already requested,
   so clear the slot first, then add, then read back:

       $S/vgh api -X DELETE "repos/$R/pulls/<pr>/requested_reviewers" -f 'reviewers[]=copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]' || true
       $S/vgh api -X POST   "repos/$R/pulls/<pr>/requested_reviewers" -f 'reviewers[]=copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]'
       $S/vgh api "repos/$R/pulls/<pr>" --jq '[.requested_reviewers[].login]'

   If `Copilot` is absent, try `$S/vgh pr edit <pr> --add-reviewer @copilot` and read
   back again. Still absent: stop with `review_received: false`, reason "request did
   not land (is Copilot review enabled?)". Record the UTC request time.

2. **Wait for the review.** Every 2 minutes, up to 20 minutes, read
   `$S/vgh api "repos/$R/pulls/<pr>/reviews"` for a review whose `user.login` contains
   `copilot` and whose `submitted_at` is after the request time. The reviews API lags,
   so also check `repos/$R/pulls/<pr>/comments` for Copilot comments created after the
   request. Use the harness's scheduled wait if it has one, otherwise `sleep 120`.
   Nothing after 20 minutes: stop with `review_received: false`.

3. **Collect this round's comments:** Copilot-authored, `created_at` after the request
   time (`$S/vgh api "repos/$R/pulls/<pr>/comments" --paginate`). Keep `id`, `path`,
   `line`, `body`, `diff_hunk`. None: the review is clean; stop.

4. **Judge each comment** against the code and the PR's intent:
   - Valid (a bug, missing validation, a security issue, a clear improvement within
     scope): fix it minimally, test first where the fix changes behavior.
   - Not applicable (false positive, out of scope, contradicts the house rules in
     `VIVI_HOUSE_RULES_FILE`, a repeat of something already handled): do not change code.
   Reply to each in one or two sentences
   (`$S/vgh api -X POST "repos/$R/pulls/<pr>/comments/<id>/replies" -f body=...`),
   then resolve its thread with the GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation, finding the
   thread id from `pullRequest.reviewThreads`.

5. **Push fixes.** Run the relevant commands from `VIVI_TEST_COMMANDS_FILE`, stage only
   the files you changed (never `git add -A`), commit "Address Copilot review (round N)",
   push. Never amend or force-push. Then go back to step 1 for the new head.
   Only dismissals this round: stop.

## Report
